In this package, headers install destination is set to `include` by ament_auto_package. It is recommended to install `include/isaac_ros_common` instead and will be the default behavior of ament_auto_package from ROS 2 Kilted Kaiju. On distributions before Kilted, ament_auto_package behaves the same way when you use USE_SCOPED_HEADER_INSTALL_DIR option.
