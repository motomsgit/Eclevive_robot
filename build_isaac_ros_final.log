If a package in a merged underlay workspace is overridden and it installs headers, then all packages in the overlay must sort their include directories by workspace order. Failure to do so may result in build failures or undefined behavior at run time.
If the overridden package is used by another package in any underlay, then the overriding package in the overlay must be API and ABI compatible or undefined behavior at run time may occur.

If you understand the risks and want to override a package anyways, add the following to the command line:
	--allow-overriding isaac_ros_apriltag_interfaces isaac_ros_nitros_bridge_interfaces isaac_ros_nova_interfaces isaac_ros_pointcloud_interfaces isaac_ros_tensor_list_interfaces

This may be promoted to an error in a future release of colcon-override-check.
